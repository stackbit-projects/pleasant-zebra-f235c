Our parents always told us to study to go to university and
become a doctor and an engineer. They were opposed to the telephone and the
Internet, and always used its waves as an excuse to keep them away from us.
They could never have imagined that one day online jobs could increase so much
that even a doctor and an engineer would earn more money and, of course, more
comfort.

But times have changed, and with the advent of the corona,
it has become clear to us that online business can be very rewarding and
effective.

Another person who cooks very well can start his own
internet business and become better known without paying millions of tomans for
renting restaurants and shops. Someone who is a little good at typing and
translating can take on various projects and make a living with them.

In this article from the new blog, we will mention some ways
to earn money from the Internet and Internet jobs . If you want to make money
on the internet for yourself, it is better to know that at any age you are, it
is quite possible to be . Read this article to the end to find the right way to
make money on the internet for yourself.

## Online jobs that have a decent income

The good thing about online business is that you only have
to worry about buying internet packages, and you probably need to get the raw
materials for your business. Now these raw materials can be a skill that helps
you get the job done, or physical equipment to get the job done; Whatever it
is, it is easy and inexpensive. Anyone of any age can think of having an online
job.

For example, students are often looking for part-time jobs
and often end up in cafes around the dormitory. For a student who, according to
some professors, " should be a full-time student " and study,
physical work is just a waste of energy and time. This is where some students
move on to writing each other's articles and dissertations.

 

I try to be neutral and not talk about right and wrong; But
if you are a student and looking for a source of income for yourself, there are
always better ways. Like an internet job that is free and requires no capital.
You can do your homework and even start a business and make money.

But before we move on to online businesses, let's take a
look at online sales or managing an online business by watching the video
below. Maybe you regret it here at all or, conversely, you are more determined
to start working soon.

Well, now that we have a better view of some of the online
home -based businesses, here are some ideas to get you started.

Build mobile apps and games and think of a solution for
people's needs!

Now, wherever you go, people have mobile phones in their
hands, and they do 80% of the work with their phones.

For example, when you travel to another city and you do not
know where, routing applications such as Wise, badge and know-how quickly solve
your problem. If you have the skills to program or build an application, you
can be smart and create an application for the needs of the people.

You can also think of making a game, games always have a
huge fan base.

For example, the game of Mario or the mushroom eater is
nostalgic for many people and they want to play mushroom eater once again. Now
imagine that you were making a Mario game for the phone and making a few
changes to it; Of course, now this idea has been implemented by someone else
and it has been very well received.

## What if I have no idea?

It does not matter if you have no idea. It is enough to have
the skill of building an application. There are many companies looking for app
developers for their business.

But you have to introduce yourself on social media or
somehow advertise so that businesses know you. For example, subscribe to LinkedIn
and leave your portfolio. LinkedIn can be a launching pad for you. You can also
read the comprehensive guide to using LinkedIn from the new blog.

### Website design can be a safe internet job for you

After the outbreak of Corona in 1398, the prosperity of
Internet businesses increased much more and even traditional businesses took a
step towards Internet.

Apart from Corona, people also like to sit at home after 8
hours of work and daily effort and order the supermarket purchases they forgot
on the way home through the online store and have them delivered to their door.

 

They expect to do a little internet search when they want to
travel and see which city is more beautiful and popular for travel in February,
and book a trip or tour ticket from there.

Accordingly, there are many traditional businesses that need
a site and there are many other people who want to start their business through
the Internet and need to design a site .

As a result, if you know how to design a website, you can
easily earn enough money for yourself.

## Internet work for everyone

Graphic designers can also make money online. Many companies
and businesses outsource their design work. Outsourcing means hiring a person
or group outside of their own organization to do their job. If you know how to
work with Photoshop, Illustrator, and other design software, you can start a
project online and make money.

In order to be able to get graphic projects for yourself, it
is better to start with freelance sites. Once you have a good portfolio, market
yourself on LinkedIn, Instagram, and other social networks. For more details,
see Who is a Freelancer? Read how to become a freelancer.

You have to show your art masterfully. Sometimes, for the
occasion of the day, design for yourself and for free and share on social
networks. The important thing is to just be seen and be able to get more
projects for yourself.

If you have a good talent for animation and motion graphics,
focus on that. These days, people are looking for moving images with sound, and
better yet, animation and motion graphics. Be smart and set notable examples
for yourself. With this online job at home, you can easily have a high income
and will not need to be physically and full time.

#### Internet typing and translation jobs; Do not be fooled by the scammer!

The internet is full of typist job ads. Many of them are
sites that have the symbol of electronic trust, but are scammers. For example,
they say pay a guarantee to make sure you start and work; No employer does
that, so please do not be fooled by these ads.

To get typing and translation projects, there are often
freelance sites that allow you and your employers to make money.

Apart from the freelance sites that I mentioned many times in
this article, you can do it yourself and post on Instagram or market yourself
in another way so that they can send you typing and translation work.

Visit the universities’ Instagram page and follow their
students to see your page as a typist and translator. Most expert’s and
doctoral students at national universities have no time at all to translate and
type their work and try to outsource. Free and non-profit university students
are also sometimes employed, not having enough time to type and translate on
their own.

 

Of course, many online news sites and magazines require a
remote translator, which you can apply for as a translator on LinkedIn or in
the My News sites section.

#### If you are good at writing, become a content writer

If you are interested in writing and you are good at
writing, the internet job of a content writer is right for you.

Infographic: Is Your Website Losing Money?

Let me explain this to you. You do your search on Google and
many sites have answered the results. As a content writer, you are supposed to
write answers to users' questions in the form of an article.

Of course, you do not know the answers to all the questions,
but there is no problem. Research and search the Internet that you know. If
your English is good enough to understand the writing of foreign sites, your
work will work.

Content writing is not just about blogging. Sometimes you
need a content writer to write an Instagram caption. Content writers also come
to design Instagram posts and their content. So with this secure internet job,
your hands will be very open. You can also read more about the online job of a
content writer or content producer in our [Blog](https://www.seo25.com/blog/).

Becoming a content writer requires two things, first, interest
and second, patience! The rest is a skill that you can easily learn and write
the best articles. Novin Academy has a full content production training course
that teaches you this skill from zero to one hundred. If for any reason you did
not have the opportunity to take a new content production training course, we
recommend the Content Bombing Book.

 

Once you have mastered content writing skills, you need to
enter the job market. In the beginning, if you do not have a work sample, you
can start with freelance sites. It may be a little difficult at first, but you
have to walk smart and write your best. You certainly do not make a lot of
money, but focus on resume and portfolio.

When you have a good portfolio and write great, sites will
struggle to work with you.

I repeat that you must be patient. Advertise for yourself
purposefully. Post your content production portfolios on LinkedIn and Twitter. Network:
That means connecting with people whose background is similar to yours.
LinkedIn and Twitter can be a good platform for this and introduce you to
content professionals.

SEO and site optimization; A fringe internet job!

Do you know the site? If you search from chicken milk to
human life, if the site is not in the first link of Google, it is definitely on
the first page! Sometimes when you open its site, you do not necessarily get
anything, but it is one of the first Google search results.

This is where the SEO debate comes into play. SEO (Search
Engine Optimization) means improving the ranking of a website in Google search
results; With SEO, you help a site to be seen in Google search results. Exactly
what [targetedwebtraffic](https://www.targetedwebtraffic.com/) site
and many other sites do!

When you work on a site SEO, the chances of that site being
seen in Google and its products being sold increase. When the audience is
redirected to the site as a result of Google and the answer to their question,
it is likely that they will stay on the same site and make their purchase.

With this account, which site does not want SEO? If you are
a SEO, you will earn good money from his projects.

Now why did we say SEO is marginal? Because Google's
algorithms are always updated and business competition for SEO is always
fierce. You need to work on your skills and always be up to date to get
results.

We talked more about SEO in the article What is SEO than the
new blog. If you are interested in this field, we suggest you read this article
as well.

Social media admin; Be a manager at home!

Businesses have realized that they need to be present on
social media to be seen and interact with customers more. In general, activity
on social networks (including Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook)
increases the audience of companies and has long-term effects on branding  and  advertising.

But companies do not have the time to generate content for
each of their social networks and constantly publish posts, so they leave it to
one person to keep their page active and dynamic. His salary is not bad either,
because companies are well aware of the importance of social media marketing
and know that it will benefit them many times over.

If you are interested in social networks and social networks
and have a hand in design and captioning, become a virtual admin or

find a job online; All you have to do is show what you are best at and find people
who think like you.

money through it (see the article on making money from YouTube). For example, is
one of the channels that provides rich content about the latest phones in the

The main way to influence influencers is through
advertising. Some companies sponsor the work of these people or pay them for
each post and story. The income of influencers is many times better than a
normal person with a very ordinary job!

Virtual training and webinars; A reputable online job!

Internet sales cooperation business; A win-win relationship
with the employer!

I always hated the word commissioner and visitor. Every time
I heard this, or was offered such a job, I first saw in my mind the image of
myself walking and reaching different shops in the heat of summer noon, and yet
badly, they do not even want to hear me.

The sales cooperation model is in the form of receiving
commissions to sell each product , but not in a way that is disgusting! Certainly,
when you advertise on the internet for someone to sell their product, you will
not have the problems you will have in person.

All you have to do is learn how to advertise and market your
internet and learn the art of negotiation . In this case, you can make a lot of
money this way.

working with you as a sales partner. Focus on your core skills and take action.
